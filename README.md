## Hello! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Alex, and I like React.js and Databases.
I've worked on projects that include a google maps guessing game, a pet voting site, and more.
I love improving on my skills and learning new things. That's why I enroled at Dev Academy Aotearoa.
I put some of my favorite projects in my Starred page (if that's visible) you should check it out. :)
I also have a working group project linked on the left side of my page (tag hunter).
